Welcome to PocketMedDoc AI! This application is designed to assist clinicians by simplifying and speeding up medical documentation. It uses advanced AI to help you process your clinical notes quickly and efficiently.

## What can PocketMedDoc AI do?

-   **Take Notes:** Quickly jot down your clinical observations, patient symptoms, and thoughts in a simple text area.
-   **Summarize Notes:** Get a concise summary of your notes, highlighting key information.
-   **Structure Notes (SOAP):** Automatically organize your notes into the SOAP format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), which is commonly used in medical records.
-   **Translate Notes:** Translate your notes into various languages, useful for diverse patient populations or international collaboration.
-   **View Information Sources:** If the AI uses specific web sources to generate information (e.g., for up-to-date medical queries), these sources will be listed.

## How to Use PocketMedDoc AI

Using the app is straightforward:

1.  **Enter Clinical Notes:**
    -   Locate the text area labeled "Clinical Notes".
    -   Type or paste your notes into this box. You can write in various languages; the AI will attempt to understand it.

2.  **Choose an Action:**
    -   Below the notes input area, you'll find "Processing Actions".
    -   **Summarize:** Click the "Summarize" button to get a brief overview of your notes.
    -   **Structure (SOAP):** Click the "Structure (SOAP)" button. The AI will reformat your notes into:
        -   **S**ubjective: What the patient reports.
        -   **O**bjective: What the clinician observes and measures.
        -   **A**ssessment: The clinician's diagnosis or impression.
        -   **P**lan: The proposed treatment or next steps.
    -   **Translate:**
        -   First, select your desired **Target Language** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Spanish, French).
        -   Then, click the "Translate" button.

3.  **View Processed Output:**
    -   Once you click an action button, the AI will process your notes. You might see a loading indicator ("AI is thinking...").
    -   The processed text (summary, SOAP note, or translation) will appear in the "Processed Output" section.
    -   If the AI used external web pages for its response, these will be listed under "Information Sources". You can click these links to view the original source.

4.  **Copy Output:**
    -   Next to the "Processed Output" title, there's a "Copy" button.
    -   Click this button to copy the entire processed text to your clipboard. You can then paste it into another application (e.g., your Electronic Health Record system, a document).

5.  **Clear or Change Notes:**
    -   To process new notes, simply edit the text in the "Clinical Notes" input area or delete it and type new notes. The output will clear if you clear the input.

## Important Considerations

*   **Privacy and Security:**
    *   This AI tool is for assistance and training purposes.
    *   **Always verify all outputs** for accuracy and completeness before using them for clinical decisions or official records.
    *   **Do not use real Patient Identifiable Information (PII)** unless your use of this application is fully compliant with your institution's data security and privacy policies (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
    *   All interactions are processed by a third-party AI service (Google Gemini).
*   **AI is an Assistant:**
    *   The AI is a powerful tool, but it's not a substitute for professional medical judgment.
    *   It may occasionally make mistakes or misunderstand context. Critical review of its output is essential.
*   **No Internet, No Service:**
    *   The app requires an active internet connection to communicate with the AI service.
*   **Error Messages:**
    *   If you see an error message (e.g., "Please enter some notes to process," or "Failed to process notes"), please follow the instructions or try again. If issues persist, there might be a problem with the AI service or the application's configuration (which your administrator would handle).

## Accessibility

The application is designed to be responsive and should work well on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
